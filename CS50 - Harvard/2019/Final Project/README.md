Aiming to complete CS50 course, I developed a Final Project using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. The project consists of a webpage that helps people to control their finances. by utlizing a simple interface, Equity-webpage's name- possibilate the user to add all transactions he has done during the month, visualize how much money he currently has and how much was spent during the current month, and visualize all transactions that he has done during all the period he utilized the webpage. 
I also utilized a free database provider called "Firebase", but the free period is over and unfortunately the webpage can't store data about the users anymore.
